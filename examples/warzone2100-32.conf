# Found the body points of an own MG Viper droid with scanmem
# by using 'snapshot', shooting at it, using '<' and '='.
# Found out that it has 205 body points initially.
#
# The game starts with 47 droids of which only 7 are our
# own droids. The memory object dump ('>' key during run)
# and the tool 'ugsimfind' are very useful here.

# The bools are easy to discover:
# 0. run the game and "scanmem"
# 1. start a new campaign
# 2. search for 0
# 3. activate cheats
# 4. use a cheat
# 5. search for 1
# 6. jump to step 1 until two matches are found

# Cheated: Cheated, src/cheat.cpp

# Power: asPower[0].currentPower, src/power.cpp

# The currentPower is an i64 fixed point value with 32 bit before the
# point and 32 bit after it. We were lucky to find it as i32 this way.
# For ugtrain only these 32 bit count.
