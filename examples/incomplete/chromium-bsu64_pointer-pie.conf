# Discovery is also cumbersome and requires a gdb watchpoint and the
# gef framework for disassembly. But the size of the object remains hidden.

# Discovery example on openSUSE with PIE:
#
# $ ugtrain -SP chromium-bsu64_pointer-pie.conf
# # find the number of lives with scanmem
# 1> list
# [ 0] 560a8dad864c,  2 +      184364c,  heap, 2, [I64 I32 I16 I8 ]

# The important operation here is "sub    DWORD PTR [rbx+0xbc], 0x1"
# one line above the marker.
# The address of the HeroAircraft object is located in CPU register RBX.
# The lives are at offset 0xbc. So we need to look for a pointer pointing
# to 0x560a8dad864c - 0xbc = 0x560a8dad8590 which is stored in RBX.

# We are lucky here that we have a single match. The variable at static
# memory match offset 0x252e20 + exe load address contains the current
# address of the HeroAircraft object. Further values can be discovered
# by guessing the object size, dumping the pointer memory in two states,
# and comparing them.
