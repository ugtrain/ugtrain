# Found the body points of an own MG Viper droid with scanmem
# by using 'snapshot', shooting at it, using '<' and '='.
# Found out that it has 205 body points initially.
#
# The game starts with 47 droids of which only 7 are our
# own droids. The memory object dump ('>' key during run)
# and the tool 'ugsimfind' are very useful here.
